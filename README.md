# Prediction of people paying their loans or not
Using the concepts of Random forests and decision trees, I made a machine learning model for the above mentioned prediction to check which algorithm is better.
 
Lending club had aÂ [very interesting year in 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lending_Club#2016), so let's check out some of their data and keep the context in mind. This data is from before they even went public.

We will use lending data from 2007-2010 and be trying to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. You can download the dataset i edited from above. It's recommended you use the csv provided as i have cleaned the data from NA values.
